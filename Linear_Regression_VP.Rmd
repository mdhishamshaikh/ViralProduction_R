**Linear Regression to calculate viral production**\
\
Lytic viral production from three replicates can be calculated using \
1. 1 slope through all the point.\
2. 1 slope through averaged replicate over time points.\
3. 3 slopes. One through each replicate.\
\
\
General flow of lytic viral production calcualtions looks like:\
Data frame wrangling --> Adding time ranges --> calculation of slopes\
\
1. 1 slope through all points\
Using `df_sr_tp` function to create a dataframe that has all the replicates intact.
We'll then use the `slope_all_points` function to calculate slope per Sample_Type.

```{r}

data_sr<- df_sr_tp(data)
slopes_LM_AP_lytic<- slope_all_points(data_sr)

```
