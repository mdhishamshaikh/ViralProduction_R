Week 1:

1. Optimize code from step 2: viral production calculation
	
	Understanding the code, add documentation/comments and optimize the functions where possible
	NJ1.csv dataset as start => test on NJ2020.csv which has the whole experiment

Week 2: 

1. Bacterial Endpoint:

	Fix bacterial endpoint for NJ2020.csv dataset

2. Visualization

	Overview of data to start with: Timepoint_SLOU & 0_vp_source.R/overview_plots_tp_avg

	Collision rates visualization: Dia 37B, bep_cr_plot/B & 13_contact_rates.R


3. Analysing viral production results

Literature:

	VIPCAL => paper about the online tool of VIPCAL => read for everything that needs to be calculated + go to online tool for some formulas

Background experiment:

	Started from seawater (WW, 100% Bacteria/ 100% Viruses) and undergo tangential flow filtration.

	First filtration of WW to create 30 kDa virus free water (0% B/ 0% V) used for washing in second filtration.

	Second filtration of WW to create 0.22 filtrate (control, 0% B/ 100% V) and T0_concentrate that undergoes VP and VPC treatment. This should be ideally 100% B and 0% V but in the end this is 40% B and 20% V.


Analysing of VP_results:
	
	1. Transform results from T0 to WW: factorizing to transform 40% B to 100% for VP and VP_SE (propagation of error)
	2. Lytic viral production
	3. Percentage lytic cells
	4. Lysogenic viral production
	5. Percentage lysogenic cells
	6. Lysis rate bacteria (lytic and lysogenic phase)
	7. Percentage bacterial production lysed
	8. Percentage bacterial loss per day
	9. C, N & P release for both bacteria and viruses: search average values in literature
	10. Viral turnover rate

	Burst size = how many viruses will come out bacteria when viral infection. Search in literature for average value in North Sea and take this as mid burst size => 15 below and above for low and high burst size. If nothing is found: 	10, 25, 40 as burst size.
