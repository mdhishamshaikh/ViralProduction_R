\arguments{
\item{x}{Data frame with the output of the flow cytometry, has to have the \code{viralprod} class.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed on to the next function.}

\item{vp_results}{Data frame with the viral production calculation results, available in global environment. See \link{calculate_viral_production} for more details.}

\item{original_abundances}{Data frame with the abundances of bacterial and virus population in the original sample, has to have the \code{viralprod_analyze} class.}

\item{burst_sizes}{Vector with three different burst sizes. The burst size refers to the number of new viral particles released from an infected bacterial cell.}

\item{bacterial_secondary_production}{Value for the bacterial secondary production, how much new bacterial biomass is produced as a result of bacterial growth and reproduction.}

\item{nutrient_content_bacteria}{List with the amount of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphor released by a bacteria, preferred a aquatic, North Sea bacteria.}

\item{nutrient_content_viruses}{List with the amount of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphor released by a marine virus (bacteriophage).}

\item{write_output}{If \code{TRUE}, the output data frames will be saved as csv files in the same folder of the viral production calculation.
If no csv files are wanted, set to \code{FALSE}. (Default = \code{TRUE})}

\item{output_dir}{String that refers to the location of folder to save the data frames as csv files.}

\value{
Data frame with the analyzed viral production results, different parameters for estimating virus-induced mortality are calculated. A second data frame with some more information about the variables will also be available in the global environment.

\description{
Luef et al. (2009) created an online tool, \verb{Viral Production Calculator}, that assesses and analyses viral production.
Next to calculating the viral production and the proportion of lysogenic bacteria in the sample, other parameters for estimating
virus-induced mortality are determined including the lysis rate of bacteria, viral turnover time, organic carbon release and others.

Based on the original data and the output of \link{calculate_viral_production}, the same parameters are
calculated and added to the already existing data frame. Another data frame with the description and units of each of the variables
is also generated.
