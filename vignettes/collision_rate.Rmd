We will assess the colision frequency of viruses with bacteria in vira production assay. 
Compare the differences between VP and VPC treatments.\
\

The formula I'll use is-\
\

```{r}
na<- 100
nb<- 1000
ra<- 50
rb<- 5
kb<- 1.38e-23
temp<- 25+273.15
uab<- 5 #check the actual values of these


freq<- na * nb * ((ra + rb)^2) * sqrt((8 * pi * kb * temp) / uab)
  
```

Let's calculate the increase in collision frequency as the experiment progresses.\
