The `viralprod` package serves as an automated pipeline for comprehensive viral production data analysis. This versatile tool streamlines the entire process into three key steps: 

* *Calculating Viral Production*: Viral production is calculated by two primary methods: `linear regression` and `VIPCAL`.
* *Analyze Viral Production*: Determination of various parameters for estimating virus-mediated microbial mortality.
* *Visualize Viral Production*: Illustrative examples to visualize the original viral count data, calculated viral production data, or analyzed viral production data.

Before diving into the package and to ensure the correct input data for its operations, several preliminary steps are crucial. These preliminary measures encompass activities such as sampling, filtration, virus reduction assays, and flow cytometry analysis. This vignette offers invaluable insights and guidance to gain a deeper understanding of these critical preparatory procedures and to explore a comprehensive guide on effectively utilizing the package's functions.

## Preliminary steps

In the following sections, we will delve into each of these preliminary steps in greater detail to provide a deeper insight into their significance and proper execution.

### Sampling and filtration



### Viral Reduction Assay

After collecting the seawater samples, the viral reduction assay can start. First of all, the seawater undergoes tangential flow filtration to remove large bacteria and particles from the seawater. A first filtration, with a 30 kDa PES filter, will lead to virus-free seawater that is used in the second filtration to create 0.22 micrometer filtrate and virus-reduced seawater. The 0.22-micrometer filter acts as a barrier that allows smaller entities, like viruses and small bacteria, pass through while retaining larger contaminants. This step is crucial, since it helps to isolate and concentrate our samples. 

Next, three types of samples are retrieved that will be incubated in the dark for 24h. 0.22 samples from the 0.22 micrometer filtrate are the control samples since they should contain only viruses and no bacteria. On the other hand, the virus-reduced seawater should ideally contain only bacteria, but they consist of both viruses and bacteria (T0 concentrate). From this virus-reduced seawater, VP and VPC samples are collected. VPC samples are treated with an antibiotic, `Mitomycin-C`, whereas VP samples are not since bacteriophages (viruses) can undergo two different life cycles when infecting sea bacteria. VP samples will represent the lytic viral production where a bacteriophage infects a bacterial cell, replicates, produces new virions (phage particles) until the bacterial cell lyses and new bacterial cells can be infected by the virions. VPC samples will represent the lytic and lysogenic viral production. In the lysogenic cycle, the bacteriophage will integrate its genetic material into the bacterial host chromosome, instead of replicating and causing cell lysis, bacterial cell continues to grow and viral DNA is replicated with it. Now an induction is needed to cause cell lysis and in normal conditions the lysogenic viral production won't be measurable. Treatment with Mitomycin-C will inhibit DNA synthesis in the bacteria and lysogenic bacteriophages will be forced to go into the lytic cycle, measurement will be possible. 

The three sample types are incubated in the dark for 24h, subsamples are taken at different timepoints. The subsamples will represent snapshots of the viral and bacterial populations at specific time intervals of the assay. Analyzing by using a flow cytometer, this technique will rapidly sort the individual particles based on their characteristics: side scatter and green fluorescence. As output, graphs of green fluorescence vs the sidescatter are produced. The different populations can be distinguished based on their characteristics with a process called `gating`. In the gating process, executed by the user, the so called gates are drawn which represent a certain viral or bacterial population. Based on the surface of each of the gates, a bacterial or viral count can be retrieved.
