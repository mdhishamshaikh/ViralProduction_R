The imported data frame will have samples from different Projects (`Location`), 
Stations (`Expt_No`), and Depths (`Depth`). \
Sample_Type can be either VP, VPC, or 0.22\
We can have multiple time points. 6 in most cases.\
3 replicates\
\
1 expt will be from a certain depth of a certain station of a certain location. 
All data will be processed with this as a data set. We can then loop entirety of the
script for depth.station/location combinations and save the output in one `.csv` file.\
\
We have three major methods.\
1. Linear Regression.\
2. VIPCAL.\
3. VIPCAL-SD.\ 
\
\
**1. Linear Regression**\
This can be further divided into 
1. Lytic
2. Lytic + lysogenic
