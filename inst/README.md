# Example data

`viralprod` package offers some example data in the `extdata` folder. In
total, five csv files are available, one consists of the original
abundances, the other four contain the count data from the flow
cytometry step. Seawater samples were collected at incoming high tides
at Marsdiep, the Netherlands.
