`viralprod` offers an automated pipeline for viral production data
analyses in R. Researchers or marine scientists investigating marine
viruses can use this automated pipeline to calculate, analyze and
visualize viral production. Starting from a virus reduction assay, input
count data is retrieved from the flow cytometer.

`viralprod` contains a vignette with detailed information and
explanation about the package and input data, which can be found here:
